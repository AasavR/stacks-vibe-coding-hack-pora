Team: <your-name>

# Slide 2 — Problem
RWAs live in fragmented systems. Investors and lenders cannot independently verify asset existence or uniqueness.

# Slide 3 — Solution
PoRA mints verified proof NFTs: AI verifies docs → IPFS stores evidence → Clarity mints NFT → anchored to Bitcoin via Stacks.

# Slide 4 — Tech
Clarity contract, FastAPI verifier (OCR + LLM heuristics), IPFS/Arweave storage, Stacks wallet integration.

# Slide 5 — Business
Mint fees, SaaS API, enterprise integrations. Target auditors, NBFCs, custody providers.

# Slide 6 — Ask & Roadmap
Hackathon MVP, $25k for production-grade verifier and pilot; roadmap: escrow, custody integrations, compliance.
