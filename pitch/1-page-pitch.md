# PoRA â€” Proof of Real Asset (One Pager)

**Tagline:** Make physical assets verifiable on Bitcoin. AI-validated, IPFS-backed, Stacks-anchored.

## Problem
Real-world assets (gold, property, invoices) are tokenized mostly on non-Bitcoin chains or private ledgers. This creates fragmentation, opacity, and counterparty risk for lenders and investors.

## Solution
PoRA mints an immutable, verified PoRA NFT for each audited asset. AI verifies documentation, files are pinned to IPFS, and the proof is anchored on Stacks/Bitcoin.

## Business Model
- Mint fee per proof (B2B)
- SaaS API subscription for platforms and lenders
- Premium verification (human + AI) for high-value assets

## Market & Traction
- Asset managers, NBFCs, gold warehouses, and property markets.
- Initial MVP targets auditors & local lenders in pilot regions.

## Go-to-market
- Integrate with auditing firms, offer a free trial for 100 proofs
- Partnership with custody providers to accept PoRA tokens as collateral

## Ask
- Hackathon prize, $25k to build production-grade verifier and pilot with 1 auditing partner.
